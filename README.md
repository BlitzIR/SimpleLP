# SimpleLP - Rough Draft
## this model is in the early stages of development

# The Model
This Simple Linear Programming Model will the determine the profit from producing beats headphones by using the assembly cost only. The assembly numbers are based on 2014 data from Dr. Dre and uses the retail price of Beats Studio3 and Solo3 headphones. 

Due to the limited number of information given by Apple or Dr. Dre, we simply have the cost to assemble and the retail price of beats headphones.
# The Steps
1. Declare a name for the model.
2. Declare the variables as integers.
3. Initialize starting variables such as the minimum and maximum costs to assemble a pair of headphones from the two different models.
4. Indicate the objective functions as the retail prices of the headphone models.
5. *continue here*

# The Code
*unfinished as of now*

ChatGPT to clarify that 14$ is the cost to **assemble** the headphones.
